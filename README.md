# RamseyAnalysis

This project gathers data/statistics on a variety of Ramsey Theory related topics.

Data these files collect:
- Proportion of Mono K_k in a graph of size n
- Avg amount of Mono K_k in a graph of size n
- Extended both bullets above to multi-colored graphs


Java was used to generate the data, and python was used to analyze these statics.
